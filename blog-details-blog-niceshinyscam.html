                                We have a bone to pick today - and itâ€™s not a bone we usually like to pick at, but weâ€™re
                                about to spit some truth in the process. We feel as though it is essential to talk about
                                this topic for any entrepreneurs that wish to become <i>honestly</i> successful
                                businessmen and women. Letâ€™s start with the household names we know so well -
                                <i>McDonaldâ€™s, Apple, Ford, Netflix,</i> - the list goes on. All of those companies and
                                more, vow to a structure of fair, well-versed business ethics, and in result, their
                                product or service they are providing becomes so important to a consumerâ€™s life, the
                                consumer forms a connection or love for that product or service - this is the result of
                                an effective and fair business model.</p><br><br>

                            <p>Whether itâ€™s a product or service you hate to love or cannot get away from because youâ€™re
                                so addicted to it, the reason it is so wildly successful is because <i>you</i> love it
                                and you donâ€™t know why. Weâ€™ll tell ya a little secret if you didnâ€™t know it already: The
                                reason you love that product or service is because the <i>entrepreneur</i> loved
                                creating and building it as much as you enjoy utilizing it.</p>
                            <div align="center"><br>
                                <br>

                            <p>But donâ€™t worry, Carrotâ€™s here to hold your hand, and break down that passion for
                                consumerism; a notorious American characteristic, and schemes from both a consumerâ€™s and
                                entrepreneur's standpoint to protect your money. Afterwards, weâ€™ll dip our toes to even
                                dirtier water - going over a list of what to look for when these big, bad businesses
                                create terrible scams, red flags and other shady activity designed to take your money
                                and how to strive for the exact opposite of that with your brand. So, letâ€™s do it like
                                MC Hammer did and, <i>â€˜break it down!â€™</i></p>

                            <h2>A Company is Born with a <i>Healthy</i> Purpose</h2><br><br>


                            <p>This is the foundational similarity found in every single brand that we see today and if
                                it isnâ€™t a similarity between two companies, investors will value that company as
                                basically useless with a poor business model. The purpose or <i>business model</i> of
                                your company is one of the single most important factors to success within your
                                endeavors.</p>
                            <div align="center"><br>
                                <br>
                                <img src="img/blog/youre-dead-to-me.jpg" width="940" height="529"><br><br><br>
                            </div>

                            <p>Make sure that <i>any</i> business model, whatever your company may represent, is
                                something <i>you</i> would want to subscribe, purchase or be a part of. If youâ€™ve
                                answered that question with an honest â€˜yesâ€™, youâ€™ll need to make sure <i>others</i> like
                                your idea just as much as you do. Here are some methods you can take to find out if your
                                business model is an effective one:</p><br><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li> 1. Create a focus group for your product</li><br>
                                <li> 2. Let unbiased peers test your service</li><br>
                                <li> 3. Ask for feedback on social media accounts</li><br>
                                <li> 4. Reply to Amazon feedback/ratings</li><br>
                                <li> 5. Ask for feedback from established business owners</li><br>
                            </ul><br><br>

                            <p>Most importantly, ask yourself <i>what</i> the problem is that your product or service
                                solves and is the problem <i>large</i> enough to solve? We use the word â€˜largeâ€™ because
                                the issue youâ€™re solving <i>must</i> be a prevalent one, with close to hundreds of
                                thousands of people with this problem. Anything less can potentially be a waste of time,
                                depending on how the ball game is played.</p><br><br>

                            <p>If your product or service isnâ€™t solving a problem rather, producing more of a
                                convenience for others, you must also ensure that the convenience you are creating is an
                                essential one, needed for an easier life - as your consumers must believe in it to make
                                that purchase or subscription. Always remember, an entrepreneur is like good olâ€™ America
                                (or what it used to be) and that is an establishment <i>by the people, for the
                                    people</i>.</p><br><br>

                            <p>Never and we repeat, <i>never</i> create a disservice for others intentionally. Ever. It
                                may seem like common sense, but we see it all the time in the modern business world.
                                Your companyâ€™s reputation is everything, and youâ€™ll burn bridges faster than the Allies
                                burned Nazi-occupied bridges in WW2 so whatever you do, earn an honest dollar with an
                                honest product or service, no matter what you are trying to sell.</p><br><br>

                            <h2>Honesty and Kindness Will Bring Your Brand To the Top</h2>
                            <div align="center"><br>
                                <br>

                            </div>

                            <p>Remember way back, that crush you had in high school? You couldnâ€™t stop thinking about
                                them no matter how hard you tried; and the butterflies in your stomach started
                                fluttering when you got close to them or passed by? Well, when it finally came to the
                                point of saying â€˜hiâ€™ to this crush of yours, how do you think your mind told you to act?
                                Yes, to be <i>nice and generous</i> - itâ€™s all coming back now, huh? Well, thatâ€™s
                                exactly how customers want to be treated - with generosity and honesty.</p><br><br>

                            <p>Rudeness, lying and cheating never got you anywhere with a first crush or anyone else for
                                that matter. <b>The same goes for the reputation and opinions of consumers regarding
                                    your brand</b> - yes treat them like they're your crush. Consumers will expose
                                unethical businesses for treating people the wrong way - itâ€™s inevitable, like the
                                police to criminals; the bad guys will always be caught for their wrongdoing.
                                Additionally, with the <i>Me, Too</i> movement in full force, there is no telling what
                                kinds of companies, tycoons and establishments will be exposed for their unethical
                                business actions.</p><br><br>

                            <p>So with this said, why do some bad companies still have the urge to commit unethical
                                actions? Well, letâ€™s go over a few reasons why:</p><br><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li> 1. Lust for Money</li><br>
                                <li> 2. Lacking a Purpose for Business</li><br>

                            <p>Notice how these issues reflect the character of the CEO of the brand? Yes, if youâ€™re
                                dealing with a scammy company, or have in the past, chances are, youâ€™re dealing with a
                                crumby person who is running the company. The bad character displayed from their
                                employees is the same character of the owner; radiating into their employees like a
                                cheap tanning bed sunburn. Ethics lie within the hearts of entrepreneurs.</p><br><br>


                            <h2>Policies For All</h2><br><br>


                            <p>A good set of rules for you and your customers kindly reminds your employees and
                                customers that you value them, want to protect their privacy, data and any other
                                information of theirs, as well as give them the product or service that you promise
                                through your brand within a timely manner for the agreed price.</p><br><br>

                            <p>Now, if these functions are ever violated from a customer or employee standpoint, this is
                                where your set of policies come into place - whether its regards to a privacy policy, or
                                the policy agreement between you and an employee, a thorough list of rules and
                                regulations ensures any mistake that is made is conveniently and quickly resolved and
                                agreed upon by both parties. This allows for a transparent, honest product or service or
                                relationship between you and your employees. Any attempt of avoiding establishing a set
                                of rules is simply unethical.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>An agreement of rules can be existentially beneficial for you and your team. Even though
                                a set of rules may be looked at as somewhat of a burden for employees to be forced to
                                follow for employment, it creates a subtle and healthy circle of respect between you and
                                your employees.</p><br><br>

                            <p>Keeping a positive mindset as a business owner is one of the greatest unseen advantages
                                that you have over your competition. If you can successfully influence positive vibes
                                from your soul into your brand, it will become completely infectious.<i> Why does this
                                    stand so true though?</i> It simply lies within the psychology between a companyâ€™s
                                message to the viewer: If you can successfully relate with a customer physically,
                                emotionally or through a need or desire of theirs, it is the single most vital kind of
                                leverage you can gain with your potential customer.</p><br><br>

                            <p>Pulling an emotion out of a consumer is what sells your product or service; particularly
                                if you can tug their honesty and integrity strings - if they see that youâ€™re a proud,
                                sturdy company supplying customers with an honest product, they will continue to come
                                back. The customer will think of your brand as a neighborly friend; they can continue to
                                visit for help.</p><br><br>



                            <h4>Trickery is for the Birds</h4><br><br>

                            <p>The single <i>worst</i> act you can commit as a business is <i>act</i> like an honest
                                company, following everything we just told you, but instead, committing â€˜thievery in
                                disguiseâ€™ for profits. Here are some examples:</p><br><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li> 1. Hidden Subscriptions without Customer Consent</li><br>
                                <li> 2. Effective Package Design with a Poor/False Product</li><br>
                                <li> 3. Overcharges or Hidden Charges</li><br>
                                <li> 4. Lack of a Privacy Policy or Terms of Use</li><br>
                                <li> 5. Side-Effects without Warning</li><br>
                                <li> 6. False Advertising/Claims</li><br>
                                <li> 7. Disregard of Customer Ratings/Comments</li><br>
                            </ul><br><br>

                            <p>Donâ€™t be that company - nobody in the history of consumerism ever wanted to purchase a
                                piece of sh*t for $29.99, they were simply tricked into it. You wouldnâ€™t want to be that
                                entrepreneur, having trouble sleeping at night because so many customers are upset with
                                your product or service.</p><br><br>

                            <p>If you are experiencing the urge to cheat others out of their money with no explanation
                                (thereâ€™s no shame donâ€™t worry), try to <b>write a list</b> of things you like about
                                yourself, or seek a professional to talk about what is causing the temptation - it could
                                be deeper than you think. If you find that you cannot fix personal issues or dislike
                                talking to others about those matters, consider entrepreneurship not being the ideal
                                profession for you. With those self-help tips, you can learn how to respect others and
                                create a respectable company (in case thatâ€™s the issue you're facing).</p>

                            <h4>Pressures Can Pose Problems</h4><br><br>

                            <p>The pressures of building a company is the struggle that is most common for many
                                entrepreneurs - and if youâ€™re gucci on the rest of the red flags we mentioned above, we
                                suggest to focus on keeping your calm as your company grows and faces new challenges.
                            </p><br><br>

                            <p>At the end of the day, your employees are individuals; and not an extension of you.
                                Entrepreneurs must learn how to accept the moral and ethical diversity of their workers.
                                Consider new ways to work with employees in a way that is beneficial to all, while
                                including the customer into the equation.</p><br><br>

                            <p>Another obstacle of pressure that a business owner might come to realize is the
                                manipulation of an employeeâ€™s negative vibes or ideals over your own (or your vision for
                                the company), it can be detrimental if not handled properly. As this is a preventable
                                issue, it can be difficult to overcome. The biggest thought to keep in mind is the
                                values you have for your own business model, and reason behind founding your company -
                                and if theyâ€™re important to you, youâ€™ll stick close to them.</p><br><br>

                            <p>Despite a show of dominance that comes naturally with an employee trying to undermine
                                your ethics - which can often lead to an intense disagreement or confrontation -
                                instead, use honest and effective communication with the opposing party. You would do
                                the same for an upset customer, but for this particular case, youâ€™ll want to treat them
                                more personably; with direct honesty about your vision for your brand.</p><br><br>

                            <p>If they still oppose your honest vision and standpoint, and continue to encourage bad
                                ethics, you have the only (and sometimes painful) option to terminate their employment
                                (as it may be a violation of your policy agreement). The moral of the story is, <i>make
                                    sure everyone including yourself respects your companyâ€™s rules because they are
                                    essentially your <b>own</b> rules for your establishment</b></i>.</p>

                            <p>There is an exception, and that is what we refer to as â€˜positive pressuresâ€™ - ones that
                                donâ€™t jeopardize the reputation (or ethics) of your brand. If an employee or consumer
                                for example, â€˜pressuresâ€™ the board of members, developers or officers of a service or
                                product for an upgrade or new product or additional service of any fashion, they are
                                providing positive feedback or criticism if you may, to the company. That relationship
                                is a very important one to have - and we refer to this as CRM or Customer Relations
                                Management. With CRM, youâ€™re creating an identity for your customers, their needs and
                                assisting their support questions and comments in a serious and personable matter,
                                whether that customer feedback is negative or positive - itâ€™s <i>how they feel</i> that
                                should be important to you.</p><br><br>

                            <p>Take the adorable 90â€™s flick, <i>Little Rascals</i> as an example of identifying an
                                issue, and modifying a business model for a wider consumer satisfaction. An instance
                                where the clubhouse (or the â€˜companyâ€™ in this context) in the beginning of the story,
                                was a â€˜He-Man Woman-Haters Clubâ€™, and therefore all girls were not allowed. We can
                                compare this to a company that has a poor set of business rules or ethics.</p><br><br>

                            <p>If the â€˜He-Man Woman-Haters Club were a company, they would surprisingly be a very
                                successful company because at the end of the film, we see Spanky â€˜(CEO/Co-Founder)â€™ and
                                Alfalfa â€˜(CEO/Co-Founder)â€™ make wise choices to allow girls to enter and be apart of
                                their club. From a business standpoint, they make a conscious choice to <i>change their
                                    set of business rules and ethics</i> to satisfy more of the masses; the main
                                objective of a popular and successful establishment.</p><br><br>

                            <div align="center"><br>
                                <br>

                            </div>


                            <h2>Closing the Curtain</h2><br><br>
                            <p>Business ethics is arguably the most vital bloodline of a company and, without a global
                                practice of honest business ethics, the world would be surrounded by scammy companies,
                                and that goes without having to lie about it. Scams would be more of a reality and
                                keeping your information and payment information confidential would be an everyday
                                struggle, without the existence of good business ethics.</p><br><br>

                            <p>So it is our duty as a global community of entrepreneurs to vow to a good set of
                                â€˜invisible rulesâ€™ or business ethics. A society where good values are a common practice.
                                Letâ€™s work as a whole to strive away from treating people poorly, and continue to make
                                the world a better place.</p><br><br>
